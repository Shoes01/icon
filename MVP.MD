# MVP-02
Improve the narrative of "combat".

One task has different levels of completion.
Once one step is completed, the player has a chance to continue or stop.

Failing to match X icons means you lose the current step.
Failed icons don't reset for the next step -- they accumulate.
The team is put on cooldown for as many turns as they have mismatched icons
--> this means pushing your luck and failing a step wastes turns.

Each step would have to give its own reward... 

## Detour
Show the player how many tasks are in what state for each dept.
example
```
1. SIGINT
    > 2 tasks available.
    > 1 task in progress.
```

# MVP-01
Need to add icons to Task and Team
Need to use icons in combat - start simple: if all icons match, win. Else, lose.

## old mvps vvv
# MVP-06 - Task Engine II
After the combat task, a cleanup task is generated.
    "Cleanup" also uses the combat engine. Just with differen units, and thus different icons.
# MVP-05 - Task Engine
When the game starts, there will be no task.
After the first turn, a "combat task" will appear.
