# MVP-06 - Task Engine II
After the combat task, a cleanup task is generated.
    "Cleanup" also uses the combat engine. Just with differen units, and thus different icons.
# MVP-05 - Task Engine
When the game starts, there will be no task.
After the first turn, a "combat task" will appear.
# MVP-04 - Turn Engine
Allow the player to "end the turn" in the play state.
    For now, this will increment a turn counter.
